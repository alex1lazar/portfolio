# Carturesti.ro

<!-- HERO_IMAGE:Cover.png -->

Carturesti has 57 beautifully designed stores in Romania and about 1.5 million average visit for its online e-commerce platform. As much as I love going to their physical stores and am a loyal customer, after repeated failure and frustrating experiences, I gave up on their website.

So I set out to imagine a killer online experience that cements [Carturesti.ro](http://Carturesti.ro) as Romania’s favourite library.

## Carturesti cares about customers’ experience (in stores)

Each of their 57 stores is architecturally unique, thoughtfully curated, and simply a joy to spend time. The flagship Carturesti Carusel even has an [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/carture-ti-carusel-bookstore) page with 2000+ reactions and over 22k+ positive review on Google.

I’m a loyal customer to the point of annoying my girlfriend by insisting to “buy from Carturesti, not a competitor”. Yet, we hardly ever use their website.

The difference between their physical and digital experience is massive. And it’s costing Carturesti sales and customers.

## How the idea came about

1. **Few negative reviews (a false positive)** — You won’t find many bad reviews online. This is a false positive as most of their stores are in urban areas, and just like myself, if I’m unsuccessful online I find way to their stores. I asked at least 10 friends about Carturesti and all have similar frustrations. You'll rarely see a review about a bad online experience, yet that doesn't mean younger generation don't expect a better one.
2. **I stopped using their website** — I observed how my intention of checking for books or gifts on their website has declined. This is because I repeatedly failed to meet my goal. As I live close to all their store in my city, it’s easier to take a walk, go to their store to browse or ask for advice from their librarians. 
3. **Loyalty card frustration** — They have a loyalty programme called Carturesti Card. Unfortunately, there is no virtual option for the Carturesti Card, so I must have it on me all the times and scan it when I purchase from the stores.
4. **I’d trust them with my data** - Out of all the stores and e-commerce website I use, I’d be the happiest for Carturesti to take my data and use thoughtful ways to personalize, reward my purchases, and offer me a better online experience. 

An improved online experience doesn’t have to feel like a money-grab. Carturesti takes a more thoughtful approach to their customer experience, and it should stay consistent from stores to digital.

**However, the question remains: is it worth investing in a better web or mobile experience?**

## Putting the investment into perspective

I’m certain that a better web and mobile experience will increase sales over time, capture the young market (15-24y/o), and engage existing customers even more. A careful approach in improving the existing e-commerce platform, or building a mobile application, would improve their economic unit.

### Mobile vs web

**Web platforms** are cheaper to build and easily accessible via browsers. It’s already common sense that having a good web experience for desktop and mobile reduces bounce rates and increases sales. 

But the real gold pot for large retail businesses hides inside **mobile applications.** 

### Comparing usage

- [78% of people](https://www.vennapps.com/blog/35-essential-stats-on-mobile-commerce-in-2025) would rather access a store from an app compared to a mobile website.
- Retail has [3 times more](https://www.tooltester.com/en/blog/website-loading-time-statistics/) mobile sessions than desktop sessions.
- Nearly [90% of mobile time](https://techjury.net/blog/app-usage-statistics/#gref) is spent on apps.
- Gen Z, an important age group for Carturesti, spends 66% of their digital time using smartphone apps.

### Conversions and personalization in mobile apps

- 80% [of consumers](https://www.slideshare.net/EpsilonMktg/the-power-of-me-the-impact-of-personalization-on-marketing-performance/1) prefer personalized experiences
- Conversion rates from mobile apps are [3x higher](https://marketingland.com/retailers-shopping-apps-now-see-majority-e-commerce-sales-mobile-234931) than mobile sites
- Mobile shoppers [spend twice as much](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/mobile-commerce/) money as other customers.

For a retailer with Carturesti’s brand loyalty and presence, this isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the difference between leading and starting to lose ground online.

<aside>
Title:Problem TL;DR
- The homepage and uncommon navigation bar add cognitive load from the first interaction
- Lack of personalization and guidance hinders exploration
- Poor UI choices decrease the ability to make a decision
- The user’s journey is filled with barriers leading to churn and cart abandonment

## How I approached designing the solution

### Decisions grounded in psychology

All decisions are grounded in e-commerce psychology and a better approach to visual design. At a core level, the solutions start with research or tested experiments from the Baymard Institute or Nielson/ Norman Group and through my time spent analyzing how industry-leading companies approach design.

For Carturesti, this meant researching top-performing platforms in similar industries (Emag, Zalando, Apple books, Amazon, Kindle Store). It was also a conscious effort to staying true to this brand's core values and mimmicking their in-store experiences: well-designed places, lack of pressure to purchase, room for exploration and leisure.

### A UI aligned with their brand

I paired a serif (New York) with a sans serif (IBM Plex Sans) to balance the literary heritage with a modern look. It's not only an aesthetic choice, the pairing also scales nicely giving enough flexibility for headings, longer descriptions, and variations in UI for visual interest.

Carturesti often partners with designers, illustrators, and artist to create illustrations for seasonal campaigns or new launches. That’s why  I created a good neutral foundation, as neutral colours are the most used in an interface. I kept the Carturesti green but slightly improved the colour scale to match accessibility requirements. The accent orange is used with purpose to guide users towards buying actions or attracting attention to sales and recommendations.

### System thinking not screen-focused design

I place a high importance on the UI and always look deep into the details of it. Yet, for this design and for Carturesti's case, it's more important to focus on the systems and the feeling of the app.

When I decided to work on this design, the three large goals were to improve navigability, enhance exploration, remove the large barriers to purchasing, and lay the ground for personalization. All while staying away from making it feel salesly. These are big goals that can't be fixed only through UI improvements.

## Improving the experience while providing ways for growth

<!-- END_CAROUSEL -->

## What I’d do next

This design is based on public research and observation. With actual access and involvement with the team, I’d:

1. **Validate assumptions** - Interview customers and analyze behavioral data to confirm which problems hurt the most. This should be easy considering the engaged community the brand has built. 
2. **Quick wins on web** - Iteratively ship, test, and measure improvements to the web experience first. This will inform other decisions for mobile while building trust and measurable impact for stakeholders.
3. **Lay the foundation for the mobile application** - Build a team focused on creating a mobile experience with personalization as the end goal.

## Conclusion

It's clear that Carturesti has mastered how to design a bookstore. Their 57 stores are places where people spend time exploring, sipping tea, having conversations. All while reinforcing a positive behaviour and personality trait "I'm a reader". No purchase pressure from Carturesti, simply places where they're encouranged to through thoughtful design to read more.

But for now, the gap between what current generations expect and how Carturesti approaches online mediums grows larger.

When core demographics spend so much time in mobile apps, are more prone to buy from brands that offer personalization, this stops being a simple missed opportunity. It becomes strategic vulnerability.

The design I created for an imaginary Carturesti mobile app doesn't take away from what makes them unique. Instead, it extends their brand and attentive approach to where their audience spend time: online. The result is simply not related to pure UX improvements. This is a pathway to increased happinness, engagement, and loyalty to a generation that expects better experiences online. And thus, these all lead to a rise in sales making Carturesti more economically robust.
