# Carturesti.ro

Carturesti has 57 beautifully designed stores in Romania and about 1.5 million average visit for its online e-commerce platform. As much as I love going to their physical stores, I gave up on their website.

So I set out to imagine a killer online experience that cements [Carturesti.ro](http://Carturesti.ro) as Romania’s favourite library.

## Carturesti cares about customers’ experience (in stores)

Each of their 57 stores is architecturally unique, thoughtfully curated, and simply a joy to spend time. The flagship Carturesti Carusel even has an Atlas Obscura page with 2000+ reactions and over 22k+ positive review on Google.

I’m a loyal customer to the point of annoying my girlfriend by insisting to “buy from Carturesti, not a competitor”. Yet, we hardly ever use their website.

The difference between their physical and digital experience is massive. And it’s costing Carturesti sales and customers.

## How the idea came about

1. **Loyalty card frustration** — They have a loyalty programme called Carturesti Card. Unfortunately, there is no virtual option for the Carturesti Card, so I must have it on me all the times and scan it when I purchase from the stores.
2. **I stopped using their website** — I observed how my intention of checking for books or gifts on their website has declined. This is because I repeatedly failed to meet my goal. As I live close to all their store in my city, it’s easier to take a walk, go to their store to browse or ask for advice from their librarians. 
3. **Few negative reviews (a false positive)** —  I asked at least 10 friends about Carturesti and all have similar frustrations. Yet, you won’t find many bad reviews online. This is a false positive as most of their stores are in urban areas, and just like myself, if I’m unsuccessful online I find way to their stores.
4. **I’d trust them with my data** - Out of all the stores and e-commerce website I use, I’d be the happiest for Carturesti to take my data and use thoughtful ways to personalize, reward my purchases, and offer me a better online experience. 

An improved online experience doesn’t have to feel like a money-grab. Carturesti takes a more thoughtful approach to their customer experience, and it should stay consistent from stores to digital.

**However, the question remains: is it worth investing in a better web or mobile experience?**

## Putting the investment into perspective

I’m certain that a better web and mobile experience will increase sales over time, capture the young market (15-24y/o), and engage existing customers even more. A careful approach in improving the existing e-commerce platform, or building a mobile application, would improve their economic unit.

### Mobile vs web

**Web platforms** are cheaper to build and easily accessible via browsers. It’s already common sense that having a good web experience for desktop and mobile reduces bounce rates and increases sales. 

But the real gold pot for large retail businesses hides inside **mobile applications.** 

### Comparing usage

- [78% of people](https://rubygarage.org/blog/benefits-of-mobile-app-for-ecommerce) would rather access a store from an app compared to a mobile website.
- Retail has [3 times more](https://www.tooltester.com/en/blog/website-loading-time-statistics/) mobile sessions than desktop sessions.
- Nearly [90% of mobile time](https://techjury.net/blog/app-usage-statistics/#gref) is spent on apps.
- Gen Z, an important age group for Carturesti, spends 66% of their digital time using smartphone apps.

### Conversions and personalization in mobile apps

- 80% [of consumers](https://www.slideshare.net/EpsilonMktg/the-power-of-me-the-impact-of-personalization-on-marketing-performance/1) prefer personalized experiences
- Conversion rates from mobile apps are [3x higher](https://marketingland.com/retailers-shopping-apps-now-see-majority-e-commerce-sales-mobile-234931) than mobile sites
- Mobile shoppers [spend twice as much](https://www.invespcro.com/blog/mobile-commerce/) money as other customers.

For a retailer with Carturesti’s brand loyalty and presence, this isn’t a nice-to-have. It’s the difference between leading and starting to lose ground online.

## What’s broken in their experience?

I documented 20+ specific UX & UI problems across navigation, search, shopping basket, and Y.

Title:Problem TL;DR
- Uncommon navbar adds cognitive load from the first moment
- Homepage and lack of guidance hinders exploration
- Poor UI choices, especially while searching, make the user feel lost
- The user’s journey is filled with barriers leading to churn and cart abandonment

## How I approached the design

### Decisions grounded in psychology

All decisions are grounded in e-commerce psychology and a better approach to visual design. At a foundational level, the solutions start with research or tested experiments from the Baymard Institute or Nielson/ Norman Group.

I approached designing the interface by thinking about how Carturesti can target top-of-the-industry experience like Zalando or Emag, with a reduced amount of changes to their core design system.

### Design system decisions

I paired a serif with a sans serif to balance the literary heritage with a modern look. I chose platform-native serifs, both because New York from Apple works perfectly for this use case, and also because of their optimisation.

Carturesti often partners with designers, illustrators, and artist to create illustrations for an upcoming launch. Novel assets are a given, that’s why I focused on creating a good neutral foundation with a touch of an accent orange.

### True to the brand, new ways to grow

You sense that their in-person experience is designed. If you ever step into one of the Carturesti’s store you’ll see that thoughtful people have built the place, work there, and cross their doors each day.

But the largest potential lies in the younger generation (15-24 years old), who are very present in their stores. This is visible in their online traffic as well.


It only makes sense for Carturesti to ramp up their online efforts and turn this demographic into loyal customers while cementing their leadership status for the other age groups.

## What I’d do next

This design is based on public research and observation. With actual access and involvement with the team, I’d:

1. **Validate assumptions**
        - Talk with customers and understand if they have similar issues with the online experience
        - Check customer feedback and frequent issues flagged by customer-facing teams
        - Dive into data related to time spent on website, time-to-purchase, cart value, and churn
        - Create a list of engaged customers open to testing new ideas
2. **Implement and test**
        - Start with obvious improvements to the website
        - Create prototypes and have customers test them
3. **Lay the foundation for the mobile application**
    - Put together a team highly-focused on creating and maintaing the mobile application
    - Use the insights we’ve received from customers to inform design decisions for mobile
    - Design the ideal state of the application
    - Break down the implementation into different phases with a clear goal of eventually creating a personalization engine.

## Conclusion

Carturesti has earned customer loyalty through a mix of community events, great products, and thoughtful stores.

Through the design proposed, their online experience stops being a mere extension of their amazing stores, and becomes a more potent side of the business.
